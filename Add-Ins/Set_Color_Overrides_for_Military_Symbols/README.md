**Set Color Overrides for Military Symbols Add-In**

This add-in sets the color locking and primitive name for the color overrides for the frames, icons and modifiers in the military symbols dictionaries.  The add-in is specific to the military dictionaries that ship with ArcGIS Pro.  When adding new frames or icons to custom versions of these dictionaries this add-in should be run to ensure that the new symbols can have color overrides applied as expected.

Only point symbols in the designated style that have a Category that contains 'Frame' or 'Main Icon' will be updated.
