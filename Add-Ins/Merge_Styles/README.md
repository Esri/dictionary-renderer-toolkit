**Merge Style Add-In**

This add-in allows you to merge style items from a style to the destination style, replacing items with identical keys.  If the Replace Keys option is checked, items will be copied to the desitination style and items with identical keys will be replaced.  If the Replace Keys option is unchecked only new items that have keys that are not in the destination style will be copied.
