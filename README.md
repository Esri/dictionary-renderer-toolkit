# Dictionary Renderer Toolkit
Extend ArcGIS Pro and the ArcGIS Runtime SDKs by creating custom dictionary renderers. Dictionary renderers allow complex symbology specifications, such as those using in military symbology, to be configured and drawn in maps. This toolkit provides resources to support modifying and creating symbol dictionaries for use with the dictionary renderer to suit your symbolization requirements.
